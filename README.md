# Gameplay

There is a spaceship that player can control and tries to destroy enemy spaceships. The game can go on forever but if you lose enough lives which is 3, game ends. When you have 0 lives, the screen will show flashing "GAME OVER" writing and there will be an another writing which is written "Press the 'R' key to restart level". Obviously, when you press the 'R' at that screen game will be restarted. When you are in the actual game screen, there would be asteroid, enemy spaceships and power ups. When you start the game firstly you will see an asteroid, no other things. When you hit the asteroid it will blow up and enemy spaceships start to invade. Against these enemy spaceships, player need to be helped power ups. There are 3 kinds of power ups. Speed, TripleShot and Shield. When you pick up speed power up, it will increases your velocity for limited time but good news is it can STACK! even though it is for limited time. Triple shot power up provides triple laser shot for a limited time. Shield power up creates an protection for player. It lasts forever but when you are hit by enemy laser or enemy itself, shiled will be disintegrated. Bad news is it can not stack. There is possibility enemies can do laser shot randomly.
